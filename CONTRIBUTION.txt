You are very welcome to contribute to this tool! All you need to do to make your contribution on to the tool as a non development team member is the following:

1. git clone https://github.com/quantsareus/reprod<...>.git
2. cd reprod<...>
3. Make your edits.
4. git add --all
5. git commit -m '<description of your fabulous update>' 
6. git push origin <name_of_your_fork_branch>

However, before you can do that, you need to register on github.com, once.

If you are not familiar with the magic collab development tool 'git' already, search for the free ProGit_2020.pdf book (or a newer version) on duckduckgo.com. This is __the git book__ from two of the main git developers, Scott Chacon and Ben Straub. They explain everything perfect. (Except, why the tool is called git.) The git online help is also good.


Your improved version has to meet four little requirements to get accepted:

1. You have to provide a working version, not a wonderful if-would-be vision.
2. The update version can still be distributed as a single file.
3. The update version does not contain a GUI element.
4. An update version usually contains the features of the current version.

Other than these few requirements will - from the author's point of view - unnecessarily complicate the tiny tool. The last requirement, however, might be discussed, when offerering a significant improvement of the tool, that's ready to use.


Your accepted fork currently gets merged into the main branch once a month, when I take my research days.
